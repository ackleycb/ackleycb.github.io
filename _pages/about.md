I am a research economist at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. My research interests are primarily in health economics and industrial organization. I work with large claims databases from Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers to study issues related to health care costs, quality, and utilization. My overarching goal is to use rich data and empirical methods to identify ways to improve both private and public health care systems.

Some of my recent research projects include developing regional price indices for medical services, examining how insurance design features like tiered networks affect patient choices and negotiated prices, and studying whether reimbursement gaps between Medicaid and Medicare affect physician supply and patient care. Additional projects focus on measuring health care productivity, both by examining costs and outcomes for acute conditions and by calculating population-level changes in health-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime medical spending.. Please see my research page for links to ongoing and published research.
